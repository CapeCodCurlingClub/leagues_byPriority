# leagues_byPriority
Python code, sort people into leagues based on their priority list

Original code by Krista Longnecker 

We have several leagues where the demand exceeds the number of places available. To address this issue we require people to prioritize the leagues they wish to curl in during a single season. We seek to place as many people as possisble into their first choice league. Then, as people wish to curl in multiple leagues, they may (or may not) get all their top choices.
