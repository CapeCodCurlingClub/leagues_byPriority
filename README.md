# leagues_byPriority
Python code, sort people into leagues based on their priority list

Original code by Krista Longnecker \
updated 31 December 2023

We have several leagues where the demand exceeds the number of places available. During the registration process, we require people to prioritize the leagues they wish to curl in. The Python code uses this information to sort people into leagues. We seek to place as many people as possisble into their first choice league. Then, as people wish to curl in multiple leagues, they may (or may not) get all their top choices.\
This works with the winter 2023 curling registrations.
